# Answers 3 Working with vectors
```{r}
set.seed (1234)
# 1. Create a vector a of 10 realisations from the standard normal distribution, use rnorm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
a <- rnorm (10, mean  = 0, sd = 1)
# 2. Calculate max, min, greater than 1, less than 1
max(a) ; min (a) ; sum(a >1) ; sum(a < 1)
# 3.  Create a vector b from a standard normal distribution
b <- rnorm (10, mean  = 0, sd = 1)
# 4. Take the maximum of a and b for each element
pmax (a, b); pmin (a,b)
# 5. Identify the number of elements where a > b
sum (a>b)
# R created a logical vector of length = length (a) (and length b) where each
# element of the new vector was TRUE if the corresponding element of a was
# greater than the corresponding element of b. It then coerced the logical
# vector to an integer vector and summed the values.
```

# Answers 4 Subsetting vectors
```{r}
set.seed (1234)
# 1. Create a vector, x from a poisson distribution of length 10, with lambda = 5, use rpois
x <- rpois (10, lambda = 5)
x
# 2. Select the first and last elements using an integer vector
x[c(1L,10L )] # could have used a double vector, R would have coerced
# 3. select all but the first element
x[-1]
# 4. Return the vector according to the numerical order
sort (x)
x[order(x)]
# Order returns indices for the ordering. These can then be used to order any 
# object (of the same length), such as another vector, a dataframe etc. sort is
# only useful for that particular vector.

# 5. Use logical subsetting to select all values of x which are >5
x [x >5]
# 6. In a single line, identify the minimum value of x which is greater than 3
min (x[x>3])
# Create the vector b
b <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5)
b
# 7. Return a vector from these elements repeating the first and second element
# 3 times and twice respectively, using the names attribute of the vector
b [c(rep("a",3), rep("b",2), "e")]
# 8. Assign NA to all values of x >5
x [x>5] <- NA
x
# 9. Add 0.5 to any values less than 5, HINT NEED TO USE is.na and "&" operator
x [x<5 & is.na(x) == FALSE] <- x[x<5 & is.na(x) == FALSE] + 0.5
```

# Answers 5 Subsetting other objects
1. Run the following and answer the following questions
  + a list
  + names and the class lm. The latter means that plot.lm, summary.lm will work on it
  + 13 objects within a list
  + you get a character vector of length 1222 
2. Extract the coefficients for the model using the coef(model1) function and using indexing
  + coef(model1)
  + model1$coef
3. Extract the Species factor from the model so you get an atomic vector which is a factor 
  + `model1$model$Species` and `model1[["model"]][["species"]]` both give a vector (a factor).
  + anything else will give you a list or nothing
  + The following is an example of getting a list from a list
```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- model1["model"] # this is a list of length 1 containing a dataframe
b[[1]][,2] # this extacts the second column from the dataframe nested within a list
```
4. Turn the swiss dataset into a matrix `swiss.m <- as.matrix (swiss)`
5. Select all first and third columns and second and fourth rows, use 2 methods
```{r, echo = -1}
swiss.m <- as.matrix (swiss)
swiss.m [c(2,4), c(1,3)]
swiss.m [c("Delemont", "Moutier"), c("Fertility",   "Examination")] 
```
6. Select a single row, first in a way which produces a vector then in a way which produces another matrix. What attributes persist with each method?
```{r}
swiss.m [1,,drop = TRUE] # column names
swiss.m [1,,drop = FALSE] # dimensions, column names and rownames
```
7. Calculate the count, mean and sum of all the values are between 25 and 30 (inclusive)
```{r}
mean (swiss.m[swiss.m >=25 & swiss.m <=30]) # etc, or with less repetition
quickfx <- function (x) c(length = length(x), mean = mean(x), sum = sum(x))
quickfx(swiss.m[swiss.m >=25 & swiss.m <=30])
# a proper R programmer might do this by storing the functions in a list
# instead.
```
8. Select all the rows for towns with Rive in the names (use the grepl and rownames functions)
```{r}
swiss [grepl("Rive", rownames(swiss)), ]
```
9. remove all objects from workspace and create swiss as a matrix and a dataframe
```{r}
data(swiss)
swiss.m <- as.matrix(swiss)
swiss.df <- swiss
```
  + Use the following indexing, which gives same and different results
    + [[1]] yields different results, treats as if `[` for matrix and `[[` for dataframe.

# Answers 6 working with factors
1. load in the esoph data , data (esoph) (not really necessary but in case modfied it) and look at the help file
```{r, eval = 1}
data (esoph)
?esoph
```

2. what class is each of the variables
```{r, eval = TRUE}
lapply (esoph, class)
```
3. Repace alcohol consumption "120+" with "120 to 150"
  + Using indexing with a logical test
```{r}
esoph$alcgp2 <- as.character(esoph$alcgp)
esoph$alcgp2 [esoph$alcgp2 == "120+"] <- "120 to 150"
```
  + using ifelse
```{r}
a<- ifelse(esoph$alcgp == "120+", "120 to 150", esoph$alcgp)
b<- ifelse(esoph$alcgp == "120+", "120 to 150", as.character(esoph$alcgp))
table(a,b)
```
  + In the first case R treates the replacement vector as an integer. In the second we coerce it to character vector.
4. Dichotomise alcohol consumption into >=80 or <80
```{r}
esoph$alc.dichot <- esoph$alcgp %in% c("80-119", "120+")
table(esoph$alc.dichot, esoph$alcgp)
```
5. Run a regression model on:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
model1 <- glm(cbind(ncases, ncontrols) ~ tobgp, data = esoph, family = binomial())
model1 <- glm(cbind(ncases, ncontrols) ~ factor(tobgp, ordered = FALSE), data = esoph, family = binomial())
```
  + what has R done differently?
    + Default glm behaviour with an ordered factor is to fit it as a linear, quadratic and cubic term
    + Default glm behaviour with an unordered factor is to create indicator variables in the design matrix


# Answers 7 Using functions
1. For c, summary, mean, glm, plot examine the help menus

![alt text](figures/answertable.png)

  + If you see a function is generic in the help menu, look at the function which creates the object of that class instead, eg `?glm` to see how glm plotted, not `?plot`. If you do so you find out it has classes "glm" and "lm". `?plot.lm` tells you about how it wil be plotted. There are often links to the generic functions in the creating function, eg `anova.glm` is on the glm page.
  + Sometimes the specific functions are hidden from the user and you can't search using `?`. This is because they are designed to work behind the scenes without users having to know the specific name.
6. What will R do if a function argument is not supplied and there is no default?
Nothing, unless it needs the argument for it's calculations
```{r, eval = FALSE}
myfx <- function (x,y,z) {x + y}
myfx (1,2)
myfx2 <- function (x,y,z) {x + y + z}
myfx2(1,2) # gives an error
```
3. What values will `print (c(a = a, b = b))` result in. Guess before running.
```{r, eval = TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- 4
MyFunction <- function (a, b) {
  a <- a + 1
  b <<- b + 1
}
MyFunction (a = 2, b = 6)
print (c(a = a, b = b))
```

# Answers 8 apply family
```{r, warning = TRUE}
# 1. In the iris dataset use tapply to calculate the mean Sepal length according to Species 
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
# 2. Use lapply to determine the class of each variable and then the mean of each variable. How does the R function lapply handle the character vector?
lapply (iris, class)
lapply (iris, mean)
mean(iris$Species)
# R returns an NA for the character vector 3. For the double vectors, use apply
# to calculate row sums and column sums and compare the results with rowSums and
# colSums
iris <- iris[, sapply(iris, is.numeric) ]
## Note could have subsetted using names(iris) != "Species"
#apply (iris, 1, sum)
#apply (iris, 2, sum)
#rowSums (iris)
#colSums (iris)
```

# Answers 9 writing functions
1. Look at the esoph dataset type ?esoph into R
2. Summarise the total number of cases and controls by age group
```{r}
tapply (esoph$ncases + esoph$ncontrols, esoph$agegp, sum)
```
3.  Create a variable where the value is true for heavy smokers, defined as >19 gm per day of tobacco
```{r}
esoph$heavy.smoker <- esoph$tobgp %in% c("20-29", "30+")
```
4. Check that there are heavy smokers in each age group
```{r}
tapply (esoph$ncases + esoph$ncontrols, list( esoph$heavy.smoker, esoph$agegp), sum)
```
5. Run a logistic regression model of oesophageal cancer on heavy smoking for the whole dataset (have a look at the bottom of the ?esoph page for how to do this with aggregated data)
```{r}
model1 <- glm (cbind(ncases, ncontrols) ~ heavy.smoker, data = esoph, family = binomial)
```
6. Write a function which will extract the odds ratio for smoking > 19gm per day for each age group stratum.
```{r}
ExtractOR <- function (x) {
  model1 <- glm (cbind(ncases, ncontrols) ~ heavy.smoker, data = x, family = binomial)
  model1$coef["heavy.smokerTRUE"]
}
ExtractOR(esoph [ esoph$agegp == "35-44", ])
by (esoph, esoph$agegp, ExtractOR)
```
7. Why couldn't we use `tapply`? look at the help for the first argument in `tapply` and `by`
  + tapply only takes a single atomic vector and we needed to work with three vectors.
8. What kind of object does `by` produce?
  + it depends. This is one of the reasons many people prefer plyr or dplyr.
